# Bank Closures in the US: 2000-2020

##### Javier Orman

The **2008 financial crisis** in the United States saw the closing of numerous banks, notably some large ones (Washington Mutual Bank being the largest with $307b in assets) and many small ones. 
As a new student of programming and data science, I decided to learn and practice a few important skills by **gathering, cleaning, organizing and visualizing data** on the bank closures that have taken place in the United States over the last 20 years.

Click on the file "Bank_Closures_in_the_US.ipynb" to see the project. Please keep in mind that it may take 10-15 seconds for GitHub to render the Jupyter Notebook.
