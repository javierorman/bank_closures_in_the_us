# Bank Closures in the US: 2000-2020

##### Javier Orman

The **2008 financial crisis** in the United States saw the closing of numerous banks, notably some large ones (Washington Mutual Bank being the largest with $307b in assets) and many small ones. 
As a new student of programming and data science, I decided to learn and practice a few important skills by **gathering, cleaning, organizing and visualizing data** on the bank closures that have taken place in the United States over the last 20 years.

UPDATE 7-10-2020: There are a few issues with GitHub's rendering of dataframes in Jupyter Notebooks. You can view a static rendering of the project by [**clicking here**]( https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/javierorman/bank_closures_in_the_us/blob/master/Bank_Closures_in_the_US.html).
